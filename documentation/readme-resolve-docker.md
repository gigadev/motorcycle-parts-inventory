# Resolving Docker Compose 'ContainerConfig' Error

If you encounter the following error when running `docker-compose up`:

```
ERROR: for backend  'ContainerConfig'
KeyError: 'ContainerConfig'
```

This is usually caused by a mismatch between Docker Compose and Docker Engine versions, or by using old/stale containers or images that are not compatible with the current configuration.

## Solution Steps

1. **Remove all stopped containers, old images, and volumes:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes --remove-orphans
   ```

2. **Prune Docker system (optional, but helps clean up):**
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   ```
   (Press `y` to confirm.)

3. **Rebuild and start fresh:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **If the error persists, check your Docker Compose version:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```
   - If itâ€™s older than 2.x, consider upgrading to the latest Docker Compose (v2+), as v1.29.2 is known to have issues with newer Docker and image formats.

   **To upgrade Docker Compose on Ubuntu:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get remove docker-compose
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   docker-compose --version
   ```

5. **Try again:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

If you continue to have issues, check your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for compatibility with your Docker/Compose versions, and consult the official Docker documentation.
